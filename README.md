# GEOSPATIAL-PROJECT

## 🚀 SpaceX Launch Site Location Analysis with Folium

This project is part of a geospatial data analysis exercise using the Folium library in Python. It focuses on visualizing SpaceX launch sites and their proximity to key infrastructure like cities, highways, coastlines, and railways.

### 📍 Objectives

* Plot all known SpaceX launch sites on an interactive Folium map.
* Color-code markers based on launch success/failure.
* Use proximity analysis to calculate distance to nearby features.
* Add markers and polylines for visualizing spatial relationships.
* Draw insights based on map analysis.

### 🗺️ Key Features

* **Launch Site Markers**: Interactive markers for all launch sites.
* **Success/Failure Icons**: Green = success, Red = failure.
* **Proximity Markers**: Nearest city, railway, highway, and coastline shown.
* **Distance Lines**: Polylines show spatial proximity from launch sites to infrastructure.
* **Interactive Map**: Built with `folium.Map()` and `folium.MarkerCluster()`.

### 📊 Insights Answered

* Are launch sites in close proximity to railways?
* Are launch sites near coastlines or highways?
* Are launch sites isolated from cities?
* Do launch failures correlate with location factors?
